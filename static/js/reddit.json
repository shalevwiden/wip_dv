            "body": "I started at twinkle twinkle, I have a teacher, I have no natural talent with the piano.  I struggled very hard to learn to read the sheet music (I still use flash cards everyday even 2.5 years into learning), I can just about sight read level 2 pieces (I can play harder stuff, but I can\u2019t just sit down and immediately begin playing it).  I practice for 2 hours a day, BUT, I spend an hour of that practice doing note flash cards (about 2 minutes), chord flash cards (I practice almost every kind of chord and I do every inversion, I probably practice 50+ chords) (probably 40 minutes or so), and I practice the following for a key every day (right now I\u2019m doing minor keys), I do harmonic minor and melodic minor scales numerous times, preferably with my eyes closed, then I practice doing inversions of the root chord up and down the keyboard both hands separately (eyes closed), then I do two octave arpeggios hands separately (eyes closed), and then I practice my cadences.  This takes about 20 minutes, but if it\u2019s a new key I would spend longer.  Then for my main practice I play 3 pieces from piano adventure (my teacher assigns these and retires ones when they are ready and assigns new ones), I do a piece from Wunderkeys, a piece from easy classical works, currently f\u00fcr Elise, and  then I do sight reading practice.\n\nAnyway I am very pleased with my progress, the only prior experience I had with music stuff was failing to self teach using Alfred\u2019s 20 years ago, I gave up after 6 months or so.  My teacher says I\u2019m intermediate, but I think she\u2019s being quite generous, I would say I\u2019m just starting to reach early intermediate.

I struggled very hard to learn to read the sheet music (I still use flash cards everyday even 2.5 years into learning), I can just about sight read level 2 pieces (I can play harder stuff, but I can\u2019t just sit down and immediately begin playing it).  I practice for 2 hours a day, BUT, I spend an hour of that practice doing note flash cards (about 2 minutes), chord flash cards (I practice almost every kind of chord and I do every inversion, I probably practice 50+ chords) (probably 40 minutes or so), and I practice the following for a key every day (right now I\u2019m doing minor keys), I do harmonic minor and melodic minor scales numerous times, preferably with my eyes closed, then I practice doing inversions of the root chord up and down the keyboard both hands separately (eyes closed), then I do two octave arpeggios hands separately (eyes closed), and then I practice my cadences.  This takes about 20 minutes, but if it\u2019s a new key I would spend longer.

I can read and understand music at a higher level than that but I am not able to translate that into me actually playing it on the piano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have advanced skills in a completely different instrument, so it\u2019s been a tricky road because I obviously already know how to read music and lots of theory from that, but how the theory translates to actually playing the piano is different. My novice skills are in the areas of finger strength, posture, positioning, pedalling, coordination etc etc etc. which are obviously hella important to being able to play the piano \ud83d\ude02 playing the easier things makes it so that I can focus on learning how to hold my fingers, which fingers to use, how to achieve dynamics and musicality instead of trying to learn the song, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work with a teacher and we do have me learn some of those harder songs and practicing songs by ear (like me trying to translate favourite pop songs into chords and writing them down and playing with improvising)\u2026 I have different things I can work on depending on my mood, because if I was just playing the Faber lesson/practice songs then I would most certainly quit and not play at all anymore \ud83e\udd23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do sometimes see people playing crazy pieces as beginners that I wonder how they even had the motivation to force themselves to learn it, because I myself become discouraged easily when it takes too much effort, LOL. I also get really tense and feel muscle fatigue if I\u2019m trying too hard \ud83d\udc80&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on people\u2019s goals also\u2026 like I want to have enough skills to be able to sight read a wide variety of mid-difficulty songs vs just learn how to play one specific song or have just a memorized repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "body": "Also most people craft their way into making you think they have been playing for the shortest amount of time possible. If someone has been playing for 1 year and 11 months, he will round it up to 1 year instead of saying 2 years. If someone tells he has been playing for 2 year, if you dig up, you realize he had 5 years of lessons when he was a kid. Someone can tell you he has been playing for 1 year, but in fact it's 1 years AFTER being with a teacher, otherwise he had been playing by himself for 3 years. Or someone has been playing for 2 years, but he was already an accomplished musician in another instrument, already was fluent with music theory etc etc.. (although the last example is more legit). Someone will claim he's \"self taught\" but probably he has a friend who is classicaly trained and gives him advices, etc etc etc\n\nAnd if they are not lying, then their playing of so called advanced pieces sucks 99% of the time.\n\nI believe it's possible to play \"chopin\" after 3 months. If you treat piano as a game where only hitting the touch is needed, yes sure. But in the long term it doens't make you a better pianist in a overall as your sight reading is still shit, you don't understand anything you play. You don't know how to play good dynamics at the good moments, you lack musical maturity, and your technique is probably very poor and tensen and you will probably be too stubborn to accept learning easier pieces, and thus progressing.",

If someone has been playing for 1 year and 11 months, he will round it up to 1 year instead of saying 2 years. If someone tells he has been playing for 2 year, if you dig up, you realize he had 5 years of lessons when he was a kid. Someone can tell you he has been playing for 1 year, but in fact it&amp;#39;s 1 years AFTER being with a teacher, otherwise he had been playing by himself for 3 years. Or someone has been playing for 2 years, but he was already an accomplished musician in another instrument, already was fluent with music theory etc etc.. (although the last example is more legit). Someone will claim he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;self taught&amp;quot; but probably he has a friend who is classicaly trained and gives him advices, etc etc etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they are not lying, then their playing of so called advanced pieces sucks 99% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;#39;s possible to play &amp;quot;chopin&amp;quot; after 3 months.
